# ðŸ”· What is Node.js? (Explained like you're new to coding)
Imagine this:
You already know that JavaScript is used to make websites interactive in the browser â€” like clicking buttons, dropdowns, animations, etc. But JavaScript couldn't work outside the browser before.

Node.js changed that.

# ðŸ”¹ Node.js = JavaScript outside the browser
It lets you run JavaScript on your computer/server â€” just like Python or Java.

So now, you can use JavaScript to:

Create a web server (like your own mini version of Google)

Read/write files

Build tools

Connect to databases

Send emails, etc.


# ðŸ”· What is npm? (Node Package Manager)
Now imagine this:

You're building a big JavaScript project. Instead of writing everything yourself (like sending email, connecting to databases, or creating a login system), you can use ready-made tools (called "packages" or "libraries").

Thatâ€™s where npm comes in.

ðŸ”¹ npm = App Store for Node.js
